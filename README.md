## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project solves the problem of installing packages and setting up environment on a new installed ubuntu based distro which takes lots of time and for somebody it might take much longer to research about different packages which are good or not. It includes many scripts which are responsible for insatlling packages, setting up environment variables, installing snap packages like IDEs etc, creating startup services for undervolting Intel i-series CPUs, performing some tweaks to improve overall performance.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your system for installing packages and performing some performance tweaks.

### Run the scripts

First you should add the execute permission to the scripts.

```
chmod +x auto-package-installation.sh
```

and then execute the script.
